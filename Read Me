Created a set of tables in mysql based off of the schema provided. PHP version 5.5.9 connects with the mysql version
5.5.47 database through Apache version 2.4.7 as can be referenced in the provided artifacts: info-php.pdf, Mysqli_Config_artfact.txt.

Starting with the PHP I assumed three tables exists, which I replicated on my own LAMP server. First I connect to the
database and have a fail save in case a connection can't be made. I approached it by first searching through the 3 tables,
one at a time to match the keyword given to a possible entry in the table. Starting with table 1 (Eateries) I scan for the
keyword given, and if found enters the if statement. From this position I know I can use the foreign keys 'Type' and 'Owner'
to correlate to table 2 (Eatery Type) and table 3 (Eatery Owners). I query the foreign key to the primary key and have the
information needed to complete the form.

Table 2 and Table 3 are done in similar ways. I search through the tables identifying the keyword, and when found I enter
the scope of the table. From there I match it corresponding primary key ID to the appropriate foreign key of table 1. With
Table 1 I can correctly point to the desired table I do not have already. With all three tables known I can complete the information
needed in the form.

Assumption: The requirements wanted all the information given, regardless of what was quired. In the example given a request for
the keyword 'Restaurant' was given but not displayed in the form. I made the assumption and change that it should be shown and have
displayed it right after the Eatery Name, such as "Joels Steakhouse: Restaurant".

I was able to validate the results with what was given in the example from the given searches. Provided web artifacts of example
runs are provided with "Example_*.jpg"
